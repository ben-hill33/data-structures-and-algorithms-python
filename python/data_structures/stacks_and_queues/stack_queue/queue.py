#Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
#Define a method called isEmpty that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.
#This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
#Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
#Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the nodeâ€™s value. Should raise exception when called on empty queue
#Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue. Should raise exception when called on empty queue
