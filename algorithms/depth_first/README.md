# Code Challenge

- Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph
- [Click here](depth_first.py) for code implementation
- [Click here](../tests/test_depth_first.py) for unit tests

## Feature Tasks

- Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

### Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
