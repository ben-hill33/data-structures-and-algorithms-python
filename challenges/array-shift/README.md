# Challenge Summary

- Write a function called ```insertShiftArray``` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description

- The challenge is asking to add another index to an array. I will be using Python for this challenge and I will use the "slice" technique

## Approach & Efficiency

- Create a list with a sequence of integers
- Using the slice technique, I will create a start and stop point within that list, and assign a new index value to be inserted where I want to insert it. In this case will be the middle of the list.
